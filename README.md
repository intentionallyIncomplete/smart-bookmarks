# smart-bookmarks
Organizing bookmarks into intelligent boards. Get to where you want to go, faster.

This project has a simple goal in mind, to organize your bookmarks in an intelligent fashion. 
It uses the efficiency of a placing lists into boards and allows for extra information, like a wiki, to be added about that link.

The use of tags will be implemented as a sorting feature later. More details about the roadmap can be found NO ROADMAP LINK YET.
